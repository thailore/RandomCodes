#Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

Based on the idea from the Big Bang Theory
* user plays against a computer that randomly generates a choice
* 5 options for the user to pick
* round is played, results are displayed per round
* scoreboard is kept with top 10 ongoing winning results
* scoreboard can be reset


Dependencies:
* Python3
* [Flask Web Framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/) `pip3 install Flask`
* Python Libraries
  * [HTTP Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) `pip3 install requests`
  * [Python Simple JSON](https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html) 


Makes Extra Use of:

Running and exercising code:

1. Pull all code, keeping file structure
2. Install all missing dependencies
3. In Terminal run command `python rpsls.py`
4. Go to URL listed in terminal, likely `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
5. To play type your choice in the input bar and press enter. If choice is not one of the five, nothing will happen. Result will be displayed just below and score updated. Reset scores by clicking button.

NOTE: Will not work without internet connection due to dependency on receiving random number from "http://codechallenge.boohma.com/random" as well as dependency for pictures on other urls.
