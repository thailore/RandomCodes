Manual Scenario Tests:

1) Any pushing of any button needs to be tested
	- Pushing any of the radio station buttons should switch to said station
	- Volume button (or dial) should indeed change the volume and only within the range
	- Mute button should turn off the sound, pushing again should return sound to previous state

2) Favorite button should set favorite station upon long hold (maybe 3 seconds or so) and change station to favorite station upon short press

3) None of the buttons should work or alter the system in any way when the radio is powered off, except for the power button

4) Pushing the mute button (now muted) followed by increasing the volume should increase the volume and reset the mute to be off 

5) Pushing of two buttons at once should not cause a problem. For example pushing volume up and volume down at the same time.
